## VSCode Settings

- For all IB9JHO repositories, the directory `.vscode` contains settings files for each operating system. You should copy the correct settings file for your operating system into a new file called `settings.json` (see image below).

- When you open any project in VSCode that contains a `CMakeLists.txt` file, it will ask if you want to configure it.
  You should always select the **clang compiler** (installed above) when prompted while you are working on IB9JHO. This ensures we are all using the same build tools.
